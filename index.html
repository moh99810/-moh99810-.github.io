        <p>
           In <u>Costa Rica,</u> I recommend visiting El Volcán Arenal.  I stayed at a resort next to the volcano when I visited.  There are no cars allowed in the resort near the volcano, so everyone gets around by using golf carts.  There is a waterfall near the volcano that I walked down and the view from the bottom was amazing.

        <h3>Canada</h3>
        <p>
            I visited <u> Mont-Treblant,</u> Canada last winter when the average temperature was -14 degrees.  Even though it was freezing, the skiing was beautiful and the people that lived there were <i> so </i>welcoming. If you can bear the cold, it’s such a good place to visit in the winter. Canada also has really delicious Beavertails, which are a desert.</p>
        <h3>Washington, DC </h3>
<p> I’ve lived in <u> Washington, DC </u> my entire life, and it is one of my favorite places.  There is so much to do, and DC has some of the best food.  I am so grateful for having been raised in DC because it has taught me so much about culture and government.
